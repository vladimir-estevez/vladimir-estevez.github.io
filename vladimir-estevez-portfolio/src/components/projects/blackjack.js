  extendedDescription: "This project was part of the 'Explore New Technologies' class, where we explored new fields, as a team we decided to chose 3D game development. Given constraints like budget limitations, learning curves, and hardware restrictions, success was defined by achieving a functional and interactive VR Blackjack experience within the available timeframe. \n\n The primary goal of this project was to develop a fully immersive VR Blackjack game tailored for the Meta Quest 2 Virtual Reality set while gaining expertise in Unity3D development, VR hardware optimization, and Unity VR game builds. The game replicates the ambiance of a real-world casino blackjack table, allowing players to interact with betting mechanics in a realistic 3D environment. Core features include intuitive VR controls, a robust betting system, and animated card dealing. \n\n A major challenge was working with 3D visual assets, as we had no prior experience in this area. We learned to integrate and optimize 3D models, textures, and animations within Unity to create a polished and immersive experience. Additionally, we focused on user experience design, game mechanics, and performance optimization for VR hardware. Most of the coding was done in C# within Unity, and we learned how to build and deploy VR applications successfully on the Meta Quest 2. We also collaborated using GitHub for version control and project management.",
