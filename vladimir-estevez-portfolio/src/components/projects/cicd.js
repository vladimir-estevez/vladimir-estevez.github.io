  title: 'CI/CD Pipeline Implementation for Open Source Project',
  description: 'Implementation of a comprehensive GitLab CI/CD pipeline for an existing open-source social media application, with automated testing, documentation, and AWS deployment.',
  extendedDescription: 'This project focused on DevOps practices and CI/CD implementation rather than application development. Starting with an existing open-source social media application, we successfully configured the MongoDB database connection and then built a complete GitLab CI/CD pipeline.\n\nThe pipeline consists of six carefully orchestrated stages:\n\n- Installation: Automated dependency management for both server and client\n- Linting: Automated code quality checks with ESLint, generating HTML reports\n- Documentation: Automated JSDoc generation for API documentation\n- Build: Creation of production-ready React frontend bundles\n- Bundle: Application packaging using 7-Zip\n- Deploy: Automated deployment to AWS using S3 and Elastic Beanstalk\n\nKey achievements include setting up automated artifact generation, implementing secure AWS deployment processes, and establishing a reliable continuous deployment workflow. The project demonstrates expertise in DevOps practices, cloud deployment strategies, and CI/CD pipeline configuration.',
