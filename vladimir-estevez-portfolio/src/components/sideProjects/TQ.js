    title: 'TechQuiero: Women in Tech NGO',
    description: 'An NGO dedicated to promoting inclusion of women in technology, entrepreneurship, and innovation, operating in Mexico and Canada.',
    extendedDescription: 'TechQuiero is an NGO run by and for women that promotes inclusion in the world of technology, entrepreneurship and innovation. The initiative was born in Guadalajara, Jalisco, México, and is based in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canadá.\n\nAs part of its expansion, in 2019 TechQuiero opened a new chapter in Mexico City, with plans to create representation in Spanish and French speaking communities. Although the focus is set on women, TechQuiero is open to minorities and men who comply with our rule to create safe spaces for women and girls, both online and offline.\n\nOur Mission:\nTech Quiero\'s mission is to provide women and girls with knowledge and skills in digital employability, technical training and digital strategies that will:\n\n• Change the course of women\'s lives and integrate them into the world of STEM\n\n• Enable more women to monetize their skills and initiatives, developing professionally by offering digital services\n\n• Close the gender gap in the tech industry, start-ups and businesses, and provide training chapters to create local community impact\n\nOur Vision:\nThe world has been moving rapidly in recent years, but this growth has benefited a small part of the population. We continue to see a gender gap in business, technology and the economy in general. We believe that talent can be found equitably, but opportunities are not. This is why TechQuiero\'s proposed solution is to create safe spaces, online and offline, to learn, connect, share and create opportunities for women, girls and visible minorities.',
